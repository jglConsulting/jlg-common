# Jlg.Common

<b>For C#:</b> In order to use these common libraries: 
<br/>
<br/>
Because Nuget packages restore doesn't work anymore, in both projects JlgCommon and JlgCommonTests, you must install manually from Package Manager Console:
<br/>
<i>Install-Package SpreadsheetLight</i>
<br/>
<i>Install-Package DocumentFormat.OpenXml -Version 1.0.0</i>
<br/>
<i>Install-Package AjaxMin</i>
<br/>
<br/>
Inside Visual Studio, right click on Solution -> Add -> Existing Project -> choose "Solution Files (*.sln)" -> \Jlg.Common\JlgCommon.sln
<br/>
<br/>
This will include both JlgCommon and JlgCommonTests projects into your solution.
